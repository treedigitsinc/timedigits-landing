## Why TimeDigits Exists

Most time tracking tools charge $10-20 per user per month. A 10-person team pays $100-200/month just to track hours. TimeDigits costs $10/month for that same team - 90% less.

We built TimeDigits because time tracking shouldn't cost more than your coffee budget.

4. **Offline-first:** Works without internet connection, syncs automatically when back online
5. **Simple by design:** No bloat, no learning curve, no enterprise upselling
